## Acceptable Use Policy, continued


As engineers, you have full (Administrator) access to the computer 
and access to the Internet. Use this responsibly.

Just because you **can** do something with a computer doesn’t mean it’s *right*. Be ethical.

**With great power comes great responsibility.** 

Responsibility (*achrayut*) is also a Jewish value.
    
**Majorly inappropriate use of Internet will be reported to directors!**
